# InteractiveSaladChart
The project is an interactive map of the thousand islands with searchable island and feature names. When clicking on one of the islands you can obtain information on the local names, whether the island or feature has ports, and whether the name is duplicated in the 1 865 islands in the initial 50 miles of the St. Lawrence river.
